Sure! Here's a brief description of a number guessing game in C:

Number Guessing Game in C
The number guessing game is a simple and fun program where the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it. Here's a step-by-step description of how it works:

Initialization:

The program starts by including necessary headers, such as stdio.h and stdlib.h.
The rand() function is seeded using srand(time(0)) to ensure different random numbers each time the game is played.
Random Number Generation:

The computer generates a random number within a specified range, typically between 1 and 100, using rand() % 100 + 1.
User Input:

The player is prompted to guess the number.
The program reads the player's guess using scanf().
Comparison and Feedback:

The program compares the player's guess with the randomly generated number.
If the guess is too high, the program informs the player that the guess is too high.
If the guess is too low, the program informs the player that the guess is too low.
If the guess is correct, the program congratulates the player and ends the game.
Looping:

The game continues in a loop until the player guesses the correct number.
The player can be given a limited number of attempts or allowed to guess indefinitely.
End of Game:

Once the correct number is guessed, the program can display the number of attempts taken and optionally ask if the player wants to play again.
